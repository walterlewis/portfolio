This is the source code for my CSE383 Final Project. In this project I:

Implemented an AWS cloud computing ec2 instance to build a Bootstrap dynamic full-stack web application from scratchusing HTML/Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript\JQuery, and AJAX with a PHP and SQLite backend.

Integrated Miami University database API calls, OpenWeatherMap API calls, personal PHP server API calls, and Google Cloud API calls that retrieve dynamic Google Maps based on user ZipCode into a responsive web application.
