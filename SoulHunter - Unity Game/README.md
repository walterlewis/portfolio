This is a 2d game that I made from scratch in unity. Using GIMP 2.0 and Unity, I made the animations and overall sprited from scratch, and built the game using effects and asset packs from the unity marketplace.

The entirety of scripting was completed by myself, along with the overall game and UI design.

This project took about 3 weeks start to finish, and I found myself struggling the most through the last week or so of the project.
/*TODO talk more about dev process */
